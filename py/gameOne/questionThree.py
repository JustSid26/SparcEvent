'''
 * Write a searching algorithm that returns the index of the element if found, else returns –1.
 *  Assume that the input array is already sorted. 
 * The time complexity of the algorithm should not be greater than O(log N), Binary Search. 

{1,6,9,10,11}, targetElement = 9 

Output – 2 

{1,6,9,6,7}, targetElement = 10 

Output – -1
